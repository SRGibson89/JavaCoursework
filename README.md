# JavaCoursework
The scenario I was given was split into two programs one was to do with DNA Sequences and the other was Fibonacci numbers. The scenarios were split into different tasks that the program was to carry out in the DNA sequences there was four task that the program was supposed to do (using a premade file): 


Task One: Read the sequence and find out how many of each base there are out. 

Task Two: Determine the number of Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine there are in the sequence. 

Task Three: Find a specific pattern for example “AATGG”. 

Task Four: Find which of the bases occur the most and which occurs the least. 


In the Fibonacci program there were 8 tasks to do: 

Task one: Reproduce the Fibonacci Table to 51. Task two: produce Fibonacci Table to 100. 

Task three: check if a user number is a Fibonacci number. 

Task four: check how many random numbers are Fibonacci. 

Task five: Loop until a random number is a Fibonacci number. 

Task six: show Fibonacci numbers above and below a user's number. 

Task seven: show what Fibonacci numbers make up any given user number. 

Task eight: Fibonacci Farmer.
